"Printable View" is also a limitation for Knowledge Lightning so we are no longer able to view Knowledge Articles in a new window while working on cases. 

This extension that allows you to view knowledge articles in a separate browser window to enhance productivity while working on cases.

All you have to do is right-click on an article then click "Knowledge Classic" and the article will open in a new window.
