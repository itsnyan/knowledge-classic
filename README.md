# Knowledge Classic 

![Knowledge Classic Logo](static/logo.jpg)

This is a Google Chrome Extension I developed for Salesforce internal IT team through the Techforce Innovation Program. 

## Background

- "Printable View" is a limitation for Knowledge Lightning so we are no longer able to view Knowledge Articles in a new window while working on cases. 

- Without the Lightning extension, when we open a new browser window of Supportforce, you'll get logged out of OMNI. 

- This extension that resolves that issue and allows you open the lightning knowledge articles by converting it into Classic first.
